# calculator

this is the final project in the foundation section of the course. 

I have to make a calculator that will work with basic functions. I am not allowed to use the eval() function because it
is actually evil. 

I will try and style it similarly to the ioS calculator style. Let's have some fun, woop woop! 

Planning::: 

1. first i will create the basic structure (buttons and screen) of the calculator using flexboxes etc. 

2. here i should be able to add all the styles to the template i have created. 

3. now comes for actually incorporating functionality - probably will have to think quite a bit more when 
i get to this stage.
